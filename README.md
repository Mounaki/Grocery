## Grocery


### Goal

Online shops often sell tons of different items and this can become very messy very quickly!

Data science can be extremely useful to automatically organize the products in categories so that they can be easily found by the customers.

The goal of this challenge is to look at user purchase history and create categories of items that are likely to be bought together and, therefore, should belong to the same section.

### Challenge Description

Company XYZ is an online grocery store. In the current version of the website, they have manually grouped the items into a few categories based on their experience.
